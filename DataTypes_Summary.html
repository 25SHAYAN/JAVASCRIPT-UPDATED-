  //Data Types are Categorized into 2 Types
//the datas are categorized based on how they store in memory and how we acess it

//1. Primitive 
//primitive data are call by value type when we call it it will pass copy not original

//7types

//to make values unique we use symbol
//String,Number,Boolean,Null,undefined,Symbol,BigInt

//2. Non-Primitive or reference type
//Arrays
//Objects
//Functions

//JS is a Dynamically Typed Language
//eg:- const score = true or 3 , we didnt speciy define variable types

//in js there is no diff in float and decimal its a number
const score = 100
const scorevalue = 100.3

//boolean
const isloggedin = false

//null
const outsidetemp = null //doesnt mean 0 its nothing inside  ,empty(null means not 0)

//undefined
let useremail;
//or (both same)
let useremail1 = undefined

//symbol
const id = Symbol('123')
const anotherid = Symbol('123')

console.log(id === anotherid)//returns false  value is same but returned values are notsame

//bigint we write n after number to declare number as bigint
const bignumber = 34546745648n
console.log(typeof(bignumber));
    </script>

    <script>
        //REFERENCE OR NON-PRIMITIVE TYPES
        //ARRAY,OBJECTS,FUNCTIONS

        //arrays  declare in []
        const heros = ["Shaktiman", " naagraj" , "dogo"];

        //ojects are declared in {} and in key value pair
        let myobj = {
            name: "shayan",
            age: 22,
        }

        //functions
        //basic structre
       const myfun =  function(){
        console.log("hello");
       }

       console.log(typeof(myfun));//function object
    </script>

        //+++++++++++++++++++=MEMORY+++++++++++++++++++
        //MEMORY OF 2 TYPES STACK AND HEAP

        //WHEN WE USE PRIMITIVE TYPE WE USE STACK MEMORY(WE WILL GET COPY)
        //WHEN WE USE NON-PRIMITIVE WE USE HEAP MEMORY(WE WILL GET ORIGINAL)

        let myYoutubename = "shayandotcom" //stores in stack
        let anothername = myYoutubename
        anothername = "chaiaurcode" //copy will chage
        console.log(myYoutubename);//original not changes
        console.log(anothername);

        //we declare object
        let userOne = {
            email:"user@gmail.com",
            upi:"user@bl"
        }
        //changes original value of userone
        let userTwo = userOne

        userTwo.email = "shayan@google.com"
        console.log(userOne.email)
        console.log(userTwo.email)
